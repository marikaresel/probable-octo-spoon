# Machine Learning with Python

# Objective
To use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization.

# Project Background
ClimateWins wants to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.
