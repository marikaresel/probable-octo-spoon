# Machine Learning with Python

# Objective
To use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization.

# Project Background
ClimateWins wants to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.

# Data Sets
This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project
Data set based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for
almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more.
